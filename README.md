latex-headers
=============

Declares two the LaTeX packages _standard_ and _math_ that could be useful when typesetting documents that contain a lot of math symbols, e.g. university math assignments and essays.

One way to install these packages

    ln -s standard.sty ~/texmf/tex/latex/standard/standard.sty
    ln -s math.sty ~/texmf/tex/latex/math/math.sty
    mktexlsr

Note that some of the commands in the math package are in Icelandic.
